It is a random project my friend suggested.
I made to keep myself upto date with programming.
It was fun to make and to play.

It uses random number generator to pick any of 3(rock, paper, scissor).
Then it compares it with the users input.
Then it both inputs are passed thorugh series of if and winner is decided and scores are updated accordingly.
